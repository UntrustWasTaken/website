<h3>The ATN Night Patriot 2 is a gen 2 monocular and multi - use night vision system using 43mm inverting tubes. Runs on one cr123 battery, has a built in IR illuminator</h3>
<h3>ATN made quite a lot of addon accessories and lenses for this device, which were available to buy as different "kits", including several items. Different magnification lenses and eyepieces, scope reticle units, bayonet helmet / skullcrusher mounting arms, infrared illuminators, camera adapters, and even a bi - ocular eyepiece unit are among some of the accessories offered.</h3>
<h3>The device has two threaded holes on the side, which are the standard camera tripod / night vision mounting thread. The addon IR illuminator bolts on here, it can also accept IR illuminators of a similar design from other ATN devices.</h3>
<h3>It is possible to adapt the night patriot to pvs14 standard J arms by using a 3d printed adapter. <a href="https://untrustwastaken.github.io/website/products.html">I have made and sold some of these</a>, if you need one let me know.</h3>
<h3>The objective lenses are actually c mount threaded, you can for example put a cctv lens in there to get a magnification closer to 1x.</h3>
	
<h3>List of "kits" and their contents:</h3>
<h3>"Goggle kit" - Skullcrusher, Mounting arm</h3>
<h3>"Bi-ocular kit" - Bi-ocular eyepiece, 90mm objective lens</h3>
<h3>"The Ultimate" - Illuminated red reticle eyepiece, mounting rings, 90mm objective lens, lens magnification doubler, 15mm eyepiece, 450mw "Long range" IR illuminator, Skullcrusher, Mounting arm, camera adapter, peli case</h3>
<h3>"The Supreme Surveillance System" - 90mm objective lens, lens magnification doubler, 15mm eyepiece, "Super long range" IR illuminator, Skullcrusher, Mounting arm, camera adapter, peli case</h3>
<h3>The manual also references a "Tactical day / night system" package, which appears to combine the device with a red dot sight on a special rail, where the sight is placed in front of the unit and switched between night vision and regular modes depending on whether the monocular is attached to the rail via a quick detach mounting system. More information required.</h3>
