<h3>The ATN Night Patriot 2 is a gen 2 monocular and multi - use night vision system using 43mm inverting tubes. Runs on one cr123 battery, has a built in IR illuminator</h3>
<h3>ATN made quite a lot of addon accessories and lenses for this device, which were available to buy as different "kits", including several items. Different magnification lenses and eyepieces, scope reticle units, bayonet helmet / skullcrusher mounting arms, infrared illuminators, camera adapters, and even a bi - ocular eyepiece unit are among some of the accessories offered.</h3>
<h3>The device has two threaded holes on the side, which are the standard camera tripod / night vision mounting thread. The addon IR illuminator bolts on here, it can also accept IR illuminators of a similar design from other ATN devices.</h3>
<h3>It is possible to adapt the night patriot to pvs14 standard J arms by using a 3d printed adapter. <a href="https://untrustwastaken.github.io/website/products.html">I have made and sold some of these</a>, if you need one let me know.</h3>
