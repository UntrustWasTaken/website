<h3>The p8306c is a gen 2 inverting tube made by EEV. It has an outer diameter of 53mm (!!!) and is powered from a 3v source.</h3>
<h3>It was used in some early british goggles</h3>
<h3>Don't see these very often, they are a very obscure format and there are no modern housings for them, apart from mine :) pictures to follow</h3>
