<h3>This is a 1st generation, cascade tube rifle scope designed to fit the optics rail found on most Soviet weapons. There is no automatic brightness control or protection features.</h3>
<h3>Many of these scopes, including this one, were "demilitarised" to become legal to own in Germany. The reticle projection unit and mounting lever were removed.</h3>

<h3>This device comes from a time before modern dry cell batteries, the originals are compeltely obsolete. It's possible to modify them to use a 3x AAA battery holder instead.</h3>

<h3>You may notice some markings "N,V,S" on the unit, flipping the lever next to them switches between several internal filters which reduce the brightness of the image.</h3>
