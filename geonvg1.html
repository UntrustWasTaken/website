<h3>The GEO-NVG1 is a russian gen 3 night vision binocular system designed for use in aircraft. It can run form an external 3.5v supply from the host aircraft, or from two AA batteries installed in the device.</h3>
<h3>Uses the standard russian aviation night vision / HUD mounting system, though this can be adapted to standard mounting shrounds. <a href="https://untrustwastaken.github.io/website/products.html">I have made and sold some adapters for this purpose.</a></h3>
<h3>The front lenses have the focus fixed to infinity, and have a reflective coating applied that filters out some artificial light wavelengths. In my testing the light from a standard (visible) torch, shone somewhere on the ground in front of the goggles, was barely picked up by the intensifier tubes. It uses 37mm wired image intensifier tubes, some people have adapted these with contact plates for use in different housings.</h3>
<h3>It's hard to find information about these, the ONLY search results are a sales listing for a mismatched unit, a russian parts catalog listing for a low voltage converter module, and most importantly a promotional document showing some different versions of the NVG1, including one with "micro display for flight paramaters visualisation", the GEO-NVG1-VI. So there are also different versions with different specifications. Link at end of page.</h3>h3>
	
<h3>These goggles act very... "russian". Sometimes they turn on, sometimes they go dim, dead, do nothing, etc. I've spoken to at least one other owner who had identical problems, and we've found that turning them on every day somehow keeps them working. Not exactly sure why this is, but it seems to do something.</h3>
	
<h3>An older goggle design, the ONV-1 Skosok, was replaced with the GEO-ONV1 (not NVG1!) goggles following a helicopter crash in Syria in 2016. It's not known whether the GEO-NVG1 goggles were also replaced, though the pod design, including the reflective coating on the GEO-ONV1 appears to be more similar to the NVG1.</h3>
